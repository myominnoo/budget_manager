- [Variograms](https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/articles/variogram.html) of individuals in current subset are plotted here.
- Empirical variograms are added with a layer of automatic [`Guesstimate`](https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/reference/variogram.fit.html) parameters. 
- You can further fine-tune the parameters by selecting individual in the drop down list.
    - The drop down list support search filter and direct editing.
    - There will be a pop up window for fine-tune parameters.
    - `Center current values` will update sliders range to twice of current value, so it's easier to deal with very small or large values.
    - `Apply` butto will accept adjusted parameters and update the variogram.
- Alternative information criteria can be selected before moving to next step of model fitting, which can be useful for certain case like small samples.
- Moving to `Modeled` tab will try various models with current guesstimate parameters as initial condition.
