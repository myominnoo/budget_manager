- The vignettes section is currently a work in progress. In the future, we will develop a series of beginner friendly vignettes specifically for `ctmmweb`.
- For the time being, we include the vignettes from the `ctmm` R package, which provide detailed explanations of concepts and theory behind the core analyses supported in `ctmmweb`.
- We also provide a simple demo of `ctmmweb`, as well as a vignette for the more advanced user that demonstrates using `ctmmweb` from the command line, in combination with the `ctmm` package.
