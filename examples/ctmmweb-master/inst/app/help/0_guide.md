- Each item in the sidebar is a step in the app's workflow.
- Selecting an analysis goal or goals will highlight the required workflow steps in boldface text with a green icon.
- Each highlighted step should be completed in a linear sequence, from the top of the sidebar to the bottom.
- The analysis guide is optional, and is intended to help the beginning user get used to how the app works. It does not enable or disable any analysis steps, but simply provides visual cues. More experienced users can skip the analysis guide altogether, and go straight to the workflow steps they wish to perform.
